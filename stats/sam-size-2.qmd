## Overview

![Functions & packages for Sample Size](/pic/sample-size/sample-size-pkg-2.png)

### Typical Values

- A two-tailed test
- a significance of **0.05** and a power of **80%** was established. 

- For **nonparametric tests** on continuous variables, as a rule of thumb, calculate the sample size required for parametric tests and **add 15%**

### Effect Size

- Effect size can be defined as ‘a standardized measure of the magnitude of the mean difference or relationship between study groups’

- An index that divides the effect size by its dispersion (standard deviation, etc.) is not affected by the measurement unit and can be used regardless of the unit, and is called an ‘effect size index’ or ‘standardized effect size

- Whether an effect size should be interpreted as small, medium, or large may depend on the analysis method. 


- We use the guidelines mentioned by Cohen and Sawilowsky and use the medium effect size considered for each test in the examples below.

### Conventional Effect Size

```{r}
cohen.ES(test = "t", size = "medium")
```

### Dropout Rate

If `dr` is the dropout rate,

`N = n / (1 – dr)`

## Continuous outcome of 2 groups

`pwr.t.test()` function

- one-sample t test (type = “one.sample”)
- two-sample t test (type = “two.sample”)
- paired t test (type = “paired”).

**Cohen’s d** is used as the effect size

- Very small (d = 0.01)
- Small (d = 0.2)
- Medium (d = 0.5)
- Large (d = 0.8)
- Very large (d = 1.2)
- Huge (d = 2)

In our example, we will use medium effect size (d = 0.5).


### One-sample t-test 

Cohen's d:

$$
d = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_0}{SD}
$$

Where:

- $\mu_0$ = mean under $H_0$
- $\mu_1$ = mean under $H_1$
- $SD$ = SD under $H_0$

#### Ex 1

```{r}
pwr.t.test(d = 0.5, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8, type = "one.sample", alternative = "two.sided")
```

**N = 34** (If dropout rate of 20%, a total of 43 samples are required) 



#### Ex 2: New DM Drug

Let’s propose a study of a new drug to reduce hemoglobin A1c in type 2 diabetes over a 1 year study period. You estimate that your recruited participants will have a mean baseline A1c of 9.0, which will be unchanged by your placebo, but reduced (on average) to 7.0 by the study drug.

let’s say 5.0 and 17.0 for min and max of Hgb A1c

```{r}
sd_approx <- (17 - 5)/4
d1 <- (9 - 7) / sd_approx # delta / sd

pwr::pwr.t.test(n = NULL,
                sig.level = 0.05, 
                type = "two.sample", 
                alternative = "two.sided", 
                power = 0.80, 
                d = d1)
```

**N = 37** in each group (Assuming a 20% dropout rate in each arm, would require 37*5/4 subjects per arm)


If study on 50 participants, what would the power be?

```{r}
pwr::pwr.t.test(n = 25, # note that n is per arm
                sig.level = 0.05, 
                type = "two.sample", 
                alternative = "two.sided", 
                power = NULL, # ?
                d = 0.66)
```

### Two-sample t-test

Cohen's d for Welch:

$$
d = \frac{ \mu_1 - \mu_2 }{SD_{pool}} 
$$

Where

$$
SD_{pool} = \sqrt{ (SD_1^2 + SD_2^2)/2 }
$$


```{r}
pwr.t.test(d = 0.5, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8, 
           type = "two.sample",
           alternative = "two.sided")
```

Assuming a p-value of 0.05 and a power of 80% in a two-tailed test, when the effect size d = 0.5

**N = 64 x 2** (dropout rate of 20%, **Total = 160**)

### Paired t-test

```{r}
pwr.t.test(d = 0.5, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8, 
           type = "paired",
           alternative = "two.sided")
```

Assuming a p-value of 0.05 and a power of 80% in a two-tailed test, the minimum number of pairs required to demonstrate statistical signifi- cance is 34 when the effect size d = 0.5. 

Considering the dropout rate of 20%, a total of **43 pairs** are required.


### Non-parametric

#### One-sample Wilcoxon test (Table 3, no. 5)

A total of 43 was calculated by one-sample t test and adding 15% gives a total of 65.

#### Mann-Whitney U test (Table 3, no. 6)

By two-sample t test, 80 people were calculated for each group, and a total of 240 people was calculated by considering an addi- tional 15% for each group.


#### Paired Wilcoxon test (Table 3, no. 7)

The 43 pairs were calculated by paired t test, taking into ac- count an additional 15%, the total 65 pairs are required.

## Continuous outcome of ≥3 groups

### ANOVA (Parametric)

Studies that compare averages of three or more groups. 

- `k`: number of comparison groups
- `f`: means the effect size (Cohen's $f$)

$$
f = \sqrt{ \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i \times (\mu_i - \mu)^2 }{\sigma^2} }
$$

**Effect Size (f-values)**

- Small = 0.1
- Medium = 0.25
- Large = 0.4


```{r}
cohen.ES(test = "anov", size = "medium")
```


```{r}
pwr.anova.test (k = 3 , f = 0.25, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8)
```

Assume that the p-value is 0.05, the power is 80%, and the two-tailed test is performed. When the total comparison group was three groups and the effect size value was 0.25, the number of subjects calculated was **53** in each group. 

Considering a dropout rate of 20%, a **total of 198 samples** are required, which is calculated as 66 per group.

### Kruskal-Wallis test (Non-parametric)

By one-way ANOVA, 66 people were calculated for each group, and if 15% of each group is additionally considered, a total of 297 people are calculated.


## Proprotion

### Effect Size

**Cohen's h**

$$
h =  2 \times asin(\sqrt{p_1})-2 \times asin(\sqrt{p_2})
$$
**h-values**

- Small = 0.2
- Medium = 0.5
- Large = 0.8 

### One-sample proportion test 

Let’s assume that patients discharged from your hospital after a myocardial infarction have historically received a prescription for aspirin 80% of the time. A nursing quality improvement project on the cardiac floor has tried to increase this rate to 95%. How many patients do you need to track after the QI intervention to determine if the proportion has truly increased?

- the null hypothesis is that the proportion is 0.8

- the alternative hypothesis is that the proportion is 0.95.


Effect size (Cohen's h):

```{r}
ES.h(p1 = 0.95, p2 = 0.80)
```


```{r}
pwr.p.test(h = ES.h(p1 = 0.95, p2 = 0.80),
           n = NULL,
           sig.level = 0.05,
           power = 0.80,
           alternative = "greater")
```

### Two-sample proportion test (equal n)

You want to calculate the sample size for a study of a cardiac plexus parasympathetic nerve stimulator for pulmonary hypertension. You expect the baseline one year mortality to be 15% in high-risk patients, and expect to reduce this to 5% with this intervention. You will compare a sham (turned off) stimulator to an active stimulator in a 2 arm study. Use a 2-sided alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80%. 

Effect size (Cohen's h):

```{r}
ES.h(p1 = 0.15, p2 = 0.05)
```


```{r}
pwr.p.test(h = ES.h(p1 = 0.15, p2 = 0.05),
           n = NULL,
           sig.level = 0.05,
           power = 0.80,
           alternative = "two.sided")
```

We need to enroll at least **67 per arm, or 134 overall**.


### Two-sample proportion test (unequal n)

Imagine you want to enroll class IV CHF patients in a device trial in which they will be randomized 3:1 to a device (vs sham) that restores their serum sodium to 140 mmol/L and their albumin to 40 mg/dL each night. You expect to reduce 1 year mortality from 15% to 5% with this device. You want to know what your power will be if you enroll 300 in the device arm and 100 in the sham arm.


```{r}
pwr.2p2n.test(h = ES.h(p1 = 0.15, p2 = 0.05),
              n1 = 300,
              n2 = 100, 
              sig.level = 0.05,
              power = NULL,
              alternative = "two.sided")
```

This (300:100) enrollment will have **84.6% power** to detect a change from 15% to 5% mortality, with a two-sided alpha of 0.05.
